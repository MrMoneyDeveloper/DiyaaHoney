<h1>Welcome to DiyaaHoney</h1>
<p>
    This project demonstrates a honeypot‑based intrusion detection system and a management dashboard for
    incident response.  It captures connection attempts on a decoy service, analyzes attack patterns,
    and stores events in a relational database.  The system also exposes a web interface for
    monitoring activity, exploring data and performing administrative tasks.
</p>

<h2>Business Processes</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Security Incident Detection &amp; Response</strong> – The honeypot listens on a predefined port
        and records every inbound connection.  An intrusion detector analyzes the log and triggers
        alerts when suspicious behaviour (e.g. repeated brute‑force attempts) is detected.  Alerts are
        persisted to the database and delivered via e‑mail, MQTT and optional on‑device indicators.
    </li>
    <li><strong>System Administration &amp; Reporting</strong> – Administrators manage user accounts,
        review accumulated connection data and alerts, run queries and purge outdated records.  The
        dashboard supports searching and filtering, while the database GUI provides a safe read‑only
        environment for exploring tables via SQL.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Record Connection:</strong> Each time a client connects to the honeypot, the IP, port and
        timestamp are stored in the <code>connections</code> table.</li>
    <li><strong>Auto‑Alert on Brute‑Force:</strong> The intrusion detector counts failed attempts per
        address; once a threshold is crossed it inserts an entry in <code>alerts</code> and sends
        notifications.</li>
    <li><strong>User Login:</strong> Users authenticate via the web interface; sessions are managed
        securely with Flask‑Login and hashed passwords.</li>
    <li><strong>Search Connections:</strong> Analysts can filter the dashboard by IP or date range to
        investigate suspicious patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Purge Old Data:</strong> Administrators can remove obsolete connection records older than a
        specified retention period; associated alerts are deleted automatically via cascading
        constraints.</li>
</ul>
